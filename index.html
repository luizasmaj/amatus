      <h3>WELCOME TO
          <div class="amatusbaby"><a href="index2.html">AMATUS</a></div>
        <br>
     THIS PROJECT IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND, IF YOU'LL HAVE ME, I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH YOU MY THOUGHTS AND EXPERIENCES AS AN AROMANTIC PERSON LIVING IN OUR AMATONORMATIVE WORLD.
        <br>
      <br>MUCH LIKE ROMANTIC ATTRACTION, OPENING UP DOES NOT COME NATURALLY TO ME, SO I REALLY WON'T SHARE UNLESS YOU INTERACT FIRST.
        <br>
    <br> SO CLICK AND SCROLL AROUND AT YOUR OWN PACE.
      </h3>
